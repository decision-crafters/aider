# Aider Task Manager with Memory

This document outlines the implementation of a task management system with memory for Aider.

## Implementation Status

✅ **Completed Features:**

1. **Core Task Manager Module**
   - Created `taskmanager.py` with Task, Environment, TestInfo, and TaskManager classes
   - Implemented persistent storage using JSON files in `.aider/tasks/` directory
   - Added singleton pattern for global access to TaskManager instance

2. **Command Interface**
   - Added `/task` command with subcommands:
     - `/task create` - Create new tasks
     - `/task list` - List all tasks with optional status filtering
     - `/task switch` - Switch between tasks
     - `/task complete` - Mark tasks as completed
     - `/task archive` - Archive tasks for future reference
     - `/task reactivate` - Reactivate completed or archived tasks
     - `/task info` - Show detailed information about a task

3. **Architect Integration**
   - Added `--architect-auto-tasks` command-line flag
   - Implemented task detection in architect responses
   - Added automatic task suggestion based on context

4. **Testing Enhancements**
   - Added test failure tracking in tasks
   - Implemented threshold-based assistance offers
   - Tracked attempted solutions and outcomes
   - Reset failure tracking on test success
   
5. **Automated Test Resolution**
   - Added `--auto-test-tasks` command-line flag
   - Implemented automatic task creation for failing tests
   - Created progressive sophistication in fix attempts
   - Added continuous test-fix-retest loop
   - Implemented configurable retry limits via `--auto-test-retry-limit`

6. **Environment Awareness**
   - Captured operating system information
   - Saved programming language versions
   - Stored working directory information
   - Prepared for git integration

7. **Task Relationships**
   - Implemented parent/child task relationships
   - Added subtask creation and navigation

8. **Documentation**
   - Created comprehensive user guide
   - Added code documentation
   - Included testing infrastructure

9. **Tests**
   - Added unit tests for TaskManager, Task, Environment, TestInfo classes
   - Created integration tests for command interface
   - Ensured test coverage of key functionality

## Goals Achieved

1. ✅ **Persistent context across sessions** - Tasks now maintain context between Aider sessions
2. ✅ **Organized workflow management** - Users can track and manage multiple tasks
3. ✅ **Task-specific memory** - Each task maintains its own files and conversation context
4. ✅ **Reduced cognitive load** - Task switching preserves context for easy resumption
5. ✅ **Debugging continuity** - Test failure tracking and assistance helps debug issues

## Next Steps

1. **Enhanced Git Integration**
   - Track git branches per task
   - Associate commits with specific tasks
   - Implement automatic branch switching when changing tasks
   - Add task status in git commit messages

2. **Visualization Features**
   - Add progress tracking metrics
   - Create visual representations of task relationships
   - Implement a simple dashboard in Aider's UI
   - Add timeline visualization for task history

3. **Export/Import Capabilities**
   - Export tasks to external issue trackers (GitHub, JIRA, etc.)
   - Import from existing task systems
   - Implement bidirectional sync with remote issue trackers
   - Add batch import/export functionality

4. **Knowledge Management**
   - Extract reusable solutions from completed tasks
   - Build project-specific knowledge base
   - Implement smart suggestions based on past solutions
   - Add tagging system for knowledge categorization

5. **Performance Optimizations**
   - Improve task switching speed for large codebases
   - Optimize memory usage for projects with many tasks
   - Implement caching for frequently accessed task data

6. **Advanced Testing Integration**
   - Extend auto-test-tasks to support multiple test frameworks
   - Add support for targeted testing of specific components
   - Implement test coverage tracking per task
   - Add regression test generation for completed tasks
